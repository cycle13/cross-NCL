# cross-NCL
Wind components, (u,v,w), of Hurricane Rita (2005) plotted as functions of radius and pressure level
Using WRF model data
VTAN = tangential velocity v
VRAD = radial velocity u
omega = vertical velocity dp/dt
Coordinate system transformed from cartesian to cylindrical (pressure is vertical coordiante)
Components azimuthally averaged by quadrant and across whole hurricane
